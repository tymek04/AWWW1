# Programming languages
A programming language is a system of notation for writingcomputer programs.

A programming language is described by its syntax (form) and semantics (meaning). It gets its basis from formal languages.

A language usually has at least one implementation in the form of a compiler or interpreter, allowing programs written in the language to be executed.

Programming language theory is the subfield of computer science that studies the design, implementation, analysis, chracterization, and classification of programming languages.
